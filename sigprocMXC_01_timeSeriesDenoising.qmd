## Imports and signal generation

We will create a signal with a sampling rate of 1000Hz (1000 samples/s), and a
length of three seconds. It will be created by linear interolation between some 
random time points ($p = 15$).

```{python}
import numba as nb
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import scipy.io as sio
import scipy.signal
from scipy import *
import copy

# set the seed
np.random.seed(42)

# create signal
srate = 1000 # Sampling rate (samples/sec, Hz.)
freq = 1/srate  # Frequency
time = np.arange(0, 3, freq) # three seconds total time
n = len(time)  # Sample count
p = 15 # poles for random interpolation

# amplitude modulator and noise level
signal_amp = 30
pure_signal = np.interp(
    x=np.linspace(0, p, n),  # interpolated x coordinate
    xp=np.arange(0, p),  # original x coordinates
    fp=np.random.rand(p) * signal_amp  # y coordinates
    )

# noise level (amplitude), measured in standard deviations
noise_amp = 5
noise  = noise_amp * np.random.randn(n)

# Add noise to the signal
noisy_signal = pure_signal + noise

plt.plot(noisy_signal)
plt.plot(pure_signal)
```

## VIDEO: Mean-smooth a time series

_Mean filter works by setting each data point in the filtered signal to be an
average of the surrounding points from the original signal._

\begin{equation}
    y_t = \frac{1}{ 2k + 1 } \sum^{t+k}_{i=t-k} x_i
\end{equation}

_Now the number of data points that you go backwards in time and forwards in
time ($k$) is the key parameter of the mean smoothing filter, and that's
called the order of the filter._

_So each time point $t$ in the filtered signal $y$ is defined as the sum of all
the data points in the original signal $x$ going $t$ backwards in time, $k$ points
and $t$ forwards in time $k$ points._

_So here you sum all of these up and then you need to divide by the number of
time points, which is two K plus one._

_Here's where I implement the running mean filter in the time domain.
You will see in the section of this course on convolution that it's also
possible to implement this kind of filter in the frequency domain using
spectral multiplication. That's thanks to something called the convolution
theorem._

```{python}

@nb.jit
def mean_filter(signal, radius):

    # initialize filtered signal vector
    n = len(signal)
    filtered = np.full(n, np.nan)

    # implement the running mean filter
    k = radius # filter window is actually (k * 2) + 1
    for i in range(k, n - k):
        # each point is the average of k surrounding points
        filtered[i] = np.mean(signal[i-k:i+k+1])
    
    return filtered

radius = 20
mean_filt = mean_filter(noisy_signal, radius=20)
```

_Now I've specified $k$ here in terms of the number of points, however, time
series data, people typically think about time in terms of milliseconds or
seconds or minutes or whatever is the relevant time scale, but some meaningful
time scale not necessarily points. And that's why I convert from points from
this arbitrary index number here into time in milliseconds._

_So this is the formula. Basically, this is saying the total number of points._

_So the total size of the window times 1000 and then divided by the sampling rate._

_And this will give you the window size in milliseconds._

_Now, in this particular case, it turns out that because I set the sampling rate
to be 1000, the window size is the same thing as the window size in points is
the same thing as the window size in milliseconds. But that's generally not the
case for sampling rates other than 1000._

```{python}
#| label: mean-smoothing
#| fig-cap: "Mean filter"
# compute window size in milliseconds (ms)
window_diameter = 1000*(2 * radius+1) / srate

#| label: fig-run-mean
#| fig-cap: "plot the noisy and filtered signals"
plt.plot(time, noisy_signal, lw=.1, label='Original')
plt.plot(time, mean_filt, color='k', label='filtered')

n = len(noisy_signal)
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel('Time (sec.)')
plt.ylabel('Amplitude')
plt.title(f'Running-mean filter with a k={window_diameter:.0f} millisecond window');
```

So there's a couple of interesting things that you can look at here.
First, it's interesting to see the signal still retains some roughness.
If we wanted the signalto be smoother we could increase $k$. At $k = 40$,
looks smoother, but the edges are still present.

Another thing you notice is some funny things happening at the start/end of the
signal called edge effects. If the filter is initialized to zero this will
create awkward jumps at the beginning and at the end.

Another possibility is to initialize the edges to be the original signal.
That doesn't give you this sudden drop down to zero, but it returns a kind of
bizarre looking, filtered signal where there's a lot of really high frequency
activity in the beginning and at the end.

### Closing remarks

So this is the running mean filter. 
It's a very useful filter, particularly when the noise is normally distributed.
This is not an appropriate filter for all kinds of noise.

This is really specific for when noise is distributed, positive and negative
relative to the signal of interest.

### Note: Edge effects

_In general, you always get something bizarre happening at the edges of your
time series Whenever you apply any kind of temporal filter. You will see
these edge effects every time you apply a temporal filter to data, regardless
of the type of filter. So then the question is what do you do with these edge points?_

* _Set them to be the original signal._
* _Ignore them by cropping off the initial/final data points from the filtered signal._

_Unfortunately, there's never a best or optimal way that always works for
dealing with edge effects. So usually you have to figure out what's the best
way to deal with edge effects on a case by case basis given your specific application._


## VIDEO: Gaussian-smooth a time series

Gaussian smoothing is very similar to Mean-smoothing, but it uses a Gaussian
weight instead of a constant weight of $1/n$. The formula looks like this:

\begin{equation}
    y_t = \sum^{t+k}_{i=t-k} x_i g_i
\end{equation}

The formula is nearly the same as in the case of the gaussian smoothing filter.
The mean smoothing filter had another term outside the summation here, and that
term was dividing by the total number of points in the kernel, which was
$2k + 1$. The gaussian filter uses a weighting function $g_i$, a function that
encloses an area of one (total probability density is one).

The result of a gaussian filter tends to be smoother than those of its
mean-based counterpart, albeit the edges are even more roughen up.

### The gaussian window/kernel

A Gaussian  starts at zero and it ends at zero and it goes up to one. The
formula is:

\begin{equation}
    g = \exp \left( \frac{-4 \ln (2) t^2}{w^2} \right)
\end{equation}

The important thing about this formula to recognize is $e$ ($\exp$) to the
$-t^2$ over something. The $t$ refers to time and it's good to have time be
centered at zero because the maximum weight is reached (one?) at that point,
$t=0$

Note this is a more intuitive formulation of the Gaussian that allows you to
specify $w$ parameter, which controls the width of the distribution in terms
of a quantity called full width at half maximum (FWHM).

FWHM is the distance horizontal between the two closest points to the
vertical-mid point of the distribution (50% gain). It is an intuitive parameter
because you can think about it in terms of how much smoothing you want to apply.

So if you want to apply, let's say ten milliseconds of smoothing, you set
$w = 10$.

#### Python implementation.

A python implementation of the gaussian kernel would look like this:

```{python}
@nb.jit
def make_gaussian(srate, radius, fwhm):
    k = radius
    positions = np.arange(-k, k + 1)
    time = 1000 * positions/srate
    gain = np.exp( -(4 * np.log(2) * time**2) / fwhm**2 )
    return time, gain
```

Gaussian kernels are defined by their FWHM, and $k$, which represents the
temporal span of the kernel (from $-k$ to $+k$). @fig-gauss-kernel shows three 
kernels with $FWHM = 25$, and three diffrent but window sizes. The first thing
we notice is that the empirical $FWHM$ depicted on the legend is not exactly
the same. This is due several factors, with sampling rate playing the biggest
role (We have a sample, not an infinite number of time points).

When $k = 10$, the kernel is a narrow window with a short time span. In fact,
it is too short, as the gain do not reach the bottom. The empirical FWHM
is shifted upwards, becoming the lowest point of the kernel, instead of the
vertical mid-point. $k = 25$ is a more reasonable value, and $k = 50$ is even 
better, reaching down to near-zero vales.
It's always good to check these filters that you are applying to your data set.

```{python}
#| label: fig-gauss-kernel
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between $k$ and FWHM"

## create Gaussian kernel
# kernel radius
k = 100

# full-width half-maximum: the key Gaussian parameter
fwhm = 25 # in ms

def plot_gaussian_kernel(fwhm, kstyles):
    arrow_kwargs = {'arrowprops': {'arrowstyle': '<->'}}
    style = {'facecolor': 'w', 'edgecolor': 'k', 'boxstyle': 'round,pad=.2'}

    for k, color in kstyles.items():

        # Gaussian kernel
        times, gains = make_gaussian(srate, radius=k, fwhm=fwhm)
        plt.plot(times, gains, color='k')

        plt.axhline(.5, color='k', ls=':', lw=1, zorder=0)

        # FWHM
        fwhm_0 = np.argmin( (gains[:k]-.5)**2 )
        fwhm_1 = np.argmin( (gains[k:]-.5)**2 ) + k # re-set indexing
        emp_fwhm = times[fwhm_1] - times[fwhm_0]
        plt.plot(
            [times[fwhm_0],times[fwhm_1]], [gains[fwhm_0],gains[fwhm_1]],
            'o-',
            label=f"k = {k}; Emp. FWHM = {emp_fwhm:.0f}",
            )
        
        # show window length
        start, end, gain0 = times[0], times[-1], gains[0]
        plt.fill_between(x=times, y1=gain0, y2=gains, color=color)
        plt.annotate('', xy=(start, gain0), xytext=(end ,gain0), **arrow_kwargs)
        plt.text(0, gain0, f"k={k}", ha='center', va='center', bbox=style)

    # then normalize Gaussian to unit energy
    gauss_win = gains / np.sum(gains)
    plt.title(f"Gaussian kernel with target FWHM = {fwhm:.02f} ms")
    plt.xlabel('Time (ms)')
    plt.ylabel('Gain')
    plt.legend()

plot_gaussian_kernel(fwhm=fwhm, kstyles={50: 'gray', 25: 'lightgray', 12: 'w'})
```

$k$ should be long enough so the edges of the kernel it defines, and the
edges of the Gaussian defined by FWHM overlap ($3\sigma$), but not longer.
There are two reasons for that: to avoid having too many points with very
little weight (gain?), and to avoid edge effects (see next section).

The last thing to note about the gaussian is it must be normalized to unit
energy $\left( \sum g = 1 \right)$. Otherwise, the scale of the filtered signal
would be different from the original. Thus, we divide every gain by the sum of
all of them.

## The actual filtering

```{python}

@nb.jit
def gaussian_filter(signal, kernel):

    # initialize filtered signal vector
    filtered = signal.copy()

    # Calculate the kernel radius and the normalizer
    k = int((len(kernel) - 1)/2)
    normalizer = np.sum(kernel)
    
    # Apply the filter
    for i in range(k+1, n-k):
        # each point is the weighted average of k surrounding points
        filtered[i] = np.sum(signal[i-k:i+k+1] * kernel)/normalizer
    
    return filtered

_, kernel = make_gaussian(srate, radius=50, fwhm=25)
gauss_filt = gaussian_filter(noisy_signal, kernel)

# plot
plt.plot(time, noisy_signal,'gray', lw=.1, label='Original')
plt.plot(time, mean_filt, 'b', label='Mean-filtered')
plt.plot(time, gauss_filt,'r', label='Gaussian-filtered')

plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
# plt.xlim(1.7, 1.8)
plt.ylabel('amp. (a.u.)')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Gaussian smoothing filter');
```

The Gaussian filter  gives us a smoother time series compared to the running
mean filter. Which one is more useful is application-dependant. These two
filters are particularly useful when the noise is normally distributed around
the signal.

### Edge effects

We have had to start at element $k+1$. If we set $k=400$, 

So if I set K to be higher, let's say K is 400.

```{python}
plot_gaussian_kernel(fwhm=fwhm, kstyles={100: 'w', 25: 'lightgray'})
```

Now, in this case, you know, the Gaussian is kind of the same here.

So maybe you think, well, it doesn't really matter.

These are all zeros, but it does matter because when we get to implementing the filter now the edge

effects are much, much bigger.

I would say this is unacceptably large, particularly considering that we don't need to have the filter

go all the way out here.

This is useless.

These are pretty much all zeros.

So that's why it's good to have K be as small as it possibly can be given that this kernel is still

tapering down to zero.

Okay.

There's one more thing I want to show you in this video, which is why it's important to normalize the

Gaussian to unit energy.

And that's really all about not dividing by anything here outside this summation function.

So what I'm going to do is comment out this line, rerun this cell.

Now, this plot doesn't change at all because the plotting happened before the normalization.

And now watch what happens when I run the filter.

So the filtered signal is now this black line.

It's kind of the same as this.

It's just that it's scaled all the way up.

So now I'll go back.

This looks really ugly to me.

I want to I want to end this video with a nice picture.

All right.

That's a good way to end this video.

So I hope you feel like you learned something about the Gaussian smoothing filter and how it differs

from the mean smoothing filter.

I encourage you, as always, to spend some time playing around with this code, trying different values

of the full width at half maximum to see how that affects the smoothness of the result.

And I will see you in the next video.
